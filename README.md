Advent Engine
=============

Advent is a defunct 2D point&click adventure game engine. This
repository contains some left over bits and pieces that still somewhat
work.

* `dirtyrectangles/` contains a newer version with dirty rectangle
rendering that doesn't work

* `advent/` contains an older, but somewhat playable version of the engine

* `prototype/` contains a really old version that no longer compiles

* `collision/` contains some random collision code, not sure where
  that came from
