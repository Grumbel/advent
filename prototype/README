Advent Prototype - An Graphical Adventure Development Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the Advent prototype, its not meant to be playable or anything
else.  Its just there as a test base to try different things.  The
code contains basically no comments, has *a lot* of memory holes and
lots of other bugs, so don't use it for anything else then TESTING!

The gfx used in this prototype are part of Retriever, an adventure
which I'll write with Advent (sooner or later, don't expect this to
happen in the near future).

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - guile 1.4
 - goops 1.0.2
 - ClanLib 0.5
 - Hermes 1.3
